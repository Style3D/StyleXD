StyleXD is the world's first open, large-scale, multi-model dataset for sewing patterns and digital garments containing over 20,000 garments produced with Style3D Studio. The dataset features each garment with comprehensive design descriptions, accurate structural labels, and multiple-view renderings across various poses and appearances. We invite AI professionals to join us in exploring fashion-related challenges, including pattern parsing, pattern generation, and sketch-based garment reconstruction, among others, and fostering an open, collaborative environment to drive innovation in fashion technology.
